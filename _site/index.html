      I am a product and engineering leader with a focused experimentation and conversion optimization background and a taste for analytics-driven MVP delivery.  I'm the UI and Experimentation Engineering Lead at VividSeats, both leading the architectural efforts and managing the team tasked with evolving the web front-end and experimentation platforms at the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm the founder of <a class="link link-inline" href="http://www.goshortwave.com/" target="_blank">Shortwave</a> - the first adaptive podcast hosting, syndication, analytics, and dynamic content stitching platform.  Most recently, I've launched <a class="link link-inline" href="http://www.podcastcampfire.com/" target="_blank">Podcast Campfire</a> - a news, discussion, and jobs board for the podcasting industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've led technology at small companies, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Direct by Vaystays, an operations, customer experience, and distribution software platform for professional vacation rental management companies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have also led engineering efforts within optimization and experimentation at much larger companies, some being Raise Marketplace, Expedia Inc., and Orbitz Worldwide. The teams I have built and I are responsible for creating both the framework for, and the mindset around lightweight A/B experimentation within these companies' eCommerce experiences.  I have a proven record of building A/B testing development practices from the ground up, focusing on experimenting and optimizing across all product verticals while simultaneously accelerating and training specific product teams to do the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also the author of <a class="link link-inline" href="http://responsivedatavisualization.com/" target="_blank">Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web</a>, a book on the processes of building code-driven data visualization upon the principles of responsive and API-first web design.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summer 2018, I started <a class="link link-inline" href="http://www.martini.limited/" target="_blank">Martini Limited</a> alongside other experienced engineering leads in the Chicago area.  We are an engineering management consultancy that specializes in aiding investors in and leaders of early stage companies to shape their technologies and best align their product development processes for measurabnle success.
    </p>

    <p>
      I fly to different cities as often as I can to talk about the future of web development, data visualization, and cross-platform design.

        After speaking at the Data Visualization Summit in fall of 2014, I was approached by an editor from John Wiley & Sons, Inc. to create a book on the same topic as my talk: responsive data visualization.
      </p>
      <p class="resume-item-description">The book is separated into two parts: The first details the growth of responsive techniques in solving for the multi-device web, applying real-world examples. The second grows these techniques, and in introducing clean visualization design, applies them to building responsive, platform-agnostic data visualizations.

        <p class="resume-item-description">
          This presentation revolves around a new way of thinking about designing for different sizes of screens: ignoring the screens altogether. It details how, as screens, input methods, and the Internet in general, permeate every device that we have, designers and engineering teams are fighting against attention spans, not screen sizes.  And as such, we need to build for as wide of an interaction field as we can, without creating overlapping work.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item-description">
          The presentation first examines how we have gotten to the multi-screen world of now, and how we are beginning to design, more and more, for devices that don't even have screens. From there, it details the efficiencies gained by building an API directly to your content, giving you the ability to then connect lightweight, specialized input methods to that content, without having to ever reach past your view layer.

          This presentation distills my experience growing the site optimization framework and practice at Orbitz Worldwide. As A/B experimentation becomes more prevalent a way to optimize conversion, designers and development teams now create even more complexity in what they serve to the user.  At best, this filters out a hyper-focused set of features.  At worst, it creates opacity around any single user’s experience.
        </p>
        <p class="resume-item-description">
          The presentation walks through how we have reached a consistent method for maintaining both experiment and optimization quality while being mindful of the greater user experience for our audience. The talk's tentpoles include: defining quantifiable success metrics, over-communicating results, failing cheaply, and not experimenting on inevitabilities.

        <p class="resume-item-description">
          This presentation poses the question: "How can responsive web design inform data visualization as we move to a mobile-dominated, multi-device internet?" It seeks to answer it by walking through the core methods of responsive design: fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries, and abstracting them out to greater lessons about designing for the modern multi-device web. Those lessons are then applied to the science of data visualization to create device-agnostic designs.

          After working so deeply to launch <a class="link link-inline" href="https://www.goshortwave.com" target="_blank">Shortwave</a> in 2017 and improve it through the first half of 2018, I wanted to create a new greenfield project with the improved architectural patterns I had developed.  However, I still wanted to be working int he podcasting space, as I care deeply about it.  What I noticed was that podcasting does not have a news and jobs board similar to Hacker News or Designer News.  So I created Podcast Campfire.  The front end is a react app, hitting a rails API app.  The apps are deployed on Heroku.  All ideation, development, adn design were done by me.  Working some nights and weekends, this project went from conception to job board affiliate revenue in 41 days.

          I had a New Year's Resolution going into 2017 to start a podcast.  I came up with some ideas, contcated a few guests, made a cover, and then started looking at hosting platforms.  And I was disappointed with each one.  So I changed my resolution to starting a company and making an app that would evolve podcast hosting, and analytics.  The differentiator came when a I developed the process for on-demand audio transcoding to allow users to stitch new clips into old episodes.  This allows podcasters to create, theoretically, infinitely monetizable content.  I began ideating on this project in June of 2017, launched it privately in fall of 2017, and publicly at Podcon 2017, in Seattle.  All conceptualization, development, and UX was done by me.  Illustration work was done by Mo Komperda.
