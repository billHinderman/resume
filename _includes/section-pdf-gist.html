      I am a product and engineering leader with a focused experimentation and conversion optimization background and a taste for analytics-driven MVP delivery.  I'm the Web and Experimentation Engineering Group Manager at VividSeats, both leading the architectural efforts and managing the team tasked with evolving the web front-end and experimentation platforms at the company.

      The teams I have built and I are responsible for creating both the framework for, and the mindset around lightweight A/B experimentation within these companies' eCommerce experiences.  I have a proven record of building A/B testing development practices from the ground up, focusing on experimenting and optimizing across all product verticals while simultaneously accelerating and training specific product teams to do the same.
