      I am a product and engineering leader with a focused experimentation and conversion optimization background and a taste for analytics-driven MVP delivery.  I'm the UI and Experimentation Engineering Lead at VividSeats, both leading the architectural efforts and managing the team tasked with evolving the web front-end and experimentation platforms at the company.

      I am also the founder of <a class="link link-inline" href="http://www.goshortwave.com/" target="_blank">Shortwave</a> - the first adaptive podcast hosting, syndication, analytics, and dynamic content stitching platform.

    <p>
      I've led technology at small companies, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Direct by Vaystays, an operations, customer experience, and distribution software platform for professional vacation rental management companies.

      I have also led engineering efforts within optimization and experimentation at much larger companies, some being Raise Marketplace, Expedia Inc., and Orbitz Worldwide. The teams I have built and I are responsible for creating both the framework for, and the mindset around lightweight A/B experimentation within these companies' eCommerce experiences.  I have a proven record of building A/B testing development practices from the ground up, focusing on experimenting and optimizing across all product verticals while simultaneously accelerating and training specific product teams to do the same.

      I’m also the author of <a class="link link-inline" href="http://responsivedatavisualization.com/" target="_blank">Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web</a>, a book on the processes of building code-driven data visualization upon the principles of responsive and API-first web design.

    <p>
      I fly to different cities as often as I can to talk about the future of web development, data visualization, and cross-platform design.
